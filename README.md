Introduction to TB Models
=========================

A shiny app reproducing the models used in the Introduction to Tuberculosis modelling course practicals, run by [TB MAC](http://tb-mac.org/) at the [2017 Union conference](http://guadalajara.worldlunghealth.org/about-us). See the [TB MAC](http://tb-mac.org/) website for course materials and further resources.

Installing the shiny app locally
--------------------------------

Manual Install
--------------

To install and run the shiny app locally on your own computer you will need to first install [R](https://www.r-project.org/), it is also suggested that you install [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). After downloading the source code from [this repository](https://www.github.com/seabbs/intro_to_tb_models) click on the `intro_to_tb_models.Rprof` file, this will open an Rstudio window. Type the following code into the command line;

``` r
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("shinydashboard")
install.packages("DT")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

To run the app open the `ui.R` file and press run, depending on your computer this may take some time.

### Using Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) is a container software that seeks to eliminate "works on my machine" issues. For installation and set up instructions see [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

This docker container is based on the [shiny](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/shiny/) docker image, see [here](https://github.com/rocker-org/shiny) for instructions on use. To run the docker image run the following in a bash shell:

``` bash
docker pull seabbs/intro_to_tb_models
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 seabbs/intro_to_tb_models
```

The shiny server can be found on port `:3838` at your local machines ip (or localhost on windows), fcdashboard can be found at `your-ip:3838/intro_to_tb_models`.
